# Autonomous Car Project

An autonomous vehicle built on a **Raspberry Pi 4** (considering a switch to Raspberry Pi Zero) with a versatile tech stack to achieve self-driving functionalities. This project aims to capture and process real-time images with **OpenCV** and utilize **FPGA** as a cloud-based accelerator, integrating a **RISC-V core** and **AI Vector Accelerator (AVA)** for enhanced machine learning performance, especially for LLM tasks.

## Objectives
- Capture real-time images for navigation using OpenCV.
- Develop a cloud-computing FPGA setup to offload intensive tasks.
- Implement a RISC-V core and AVA core for optimized AI processing, aiming to enhance LLM efficiency.

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4 (or Raspberry Pi Zero), FPGA
- **Operating System**: Embedded Linux (Yocto Project)
- **Programming Languages**: Bash, C++, Python, C, Verilog
- **Software**: OpenCV for image processing
